   we propose a local-to-global perception LiDAR-based point cloud segmentation network LGPSeg. From the local perspective, we design the Dynamic Spatial Aggregation Convolution to expand the receptive field range while avoiding a large increase in the model parameters. From the global perspective, we propose the BEV-Voxel Fusion to aggregate the global contextual information on the BEV feature maps through advanced 2D operators.

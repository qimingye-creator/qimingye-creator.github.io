[TEDRec: Transformer-based scientific collaborator recommendation via textual-edge dynamic network modeling](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ipm.2025.104283). 

 **Guan, K.**,  Huang, W., Chen, T., Chan, WKV.\*  (2025).

- This paper is recently accepted by Information Processing \& Management (CCF B, ABS-2 star).
- We implement a novel academic collaborator recommendation framework called TEDRec, comprehensively modeling the collaboration network from three key elements, i.e., temporality, textual edges, structural relationships.
- Our data construction method can provide an innovative idea to build high-quality datasets for other fields.
- **Conclusion**: The proposed framework does achieve superb performance over baseline models across all evaluation metrics, indicating excellent generalization and robustness.

[A new hybrid deep learning model for monthly oil prices forecasting](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2023.107136). 

 **Guan, K.**, Gong, X.  \*  (2023).

- This paper is recently accepted by Energy Economics (ABS-3 star).
- We introduce an independent module to preprocess IMFs generated by VMD to prevent the over-fitting problem and thus improve the forecasting precision.
- Our data augmentation can provide an innovative idea for other fields challenging to augment data artificially.
- **Conclusion**: The preprocessing of decomposed series is beneficial to capture temporal general feature patterns, thereby helping to produce more accurate and robust forecasting results than the competing benchmark models.

[The role of textual analysis in oil futures price forecasting based on machine learning approach](https://doi.org/10.1002/fut.22367) \\
Gong, X., **Guan, K.\***, Chen, Q. (2022).

[**Project**](https://www.yangsuoly.com/2021/09/01/Text-mining/) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='xLYHeSUAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C'></span></strong>

- This work is published on Journal of Futures Markets (ABS-3 star).
- We  creatively introduce text mining techniques (LDA, CNN, FinBERT, TextBlob) to forecast oil futures price.
- We offer an innovative approach to capture the trend of oil
futures prices based on natural language processing and machine learning.
- **Conclusion**: The textual features and financial features are complementary in improving forecasting performance, and the improvement can be maximized by incorporating all features.

[What drives oil prices?‚ÄîA Markov switching VAR approach.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resourpol.2021.102316) \\
Gong, X., **Guan, K.**, Chen, L., Liu, T. \*, Fu, C. (2021)

**Project** <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='xLYHeSUAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC'></span></strong>
- This work is published on Resources Policy (ABS 2-star)
- We construct a five-variable Markov switching vector auto-regressions model based on five driving factors.
- We build this model to study the impact of different oil shocks on oil prices and analyze the factors under different regime conditions.
- **Conclusion**: The oil inventory and speculative demand have more significant effects on the oil price fluctuation than the oil aggregate supply and demand, and multiple factors have cumulative effects on the oil price fluctuation and the their intensity change under different regimes.

Huang, W., **Guan, K.\***, Hu, Y.

- This working paper is under review at Remote Sensing of Environment (SCIE-Q1).
- We provide a framework to efficiently perform hyperspectral classification of small samples of vegetation, which reduces model overfitting and diminishes category imbalance interference.
- We adopt transfer learning to alleviate spectral data shortage and innovatively consider cross-domain learning of spectra.

<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi! I‚Äôm **Tiantian Zhang**, an undergraduate student in Computer Science at Columbia University (Class of 2025).  
My research interests span **machine learning theory**, **combinatorics optimization**. During my undergrad study, I am fortunate to work with Prof. Yuri Faenza, Prof. Daniel Hsu. Recently, I have been interested in LLM. I have a lot of ongoing thoughts and unaccompolished research idea where you can find on [my blogs](tiantianzz.wordpress.com), and I am always excited to talk about it.

  [*Partial Answer of How Transformers Learn Automata*]([https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20395))  
  **Tiantian Zhang**  

  We study the connection between representation theory, Fourier analysis, and how Transformers simulate finite automata, with applications to modular reasoning.

  [*Rank-Induced PL Mirror Descent*](https://tiantianzz.wordpress.com/2025/09/18/rank-induced-pl-mirror-descent/)
  **Tiantian Zhang**, Daniel Hsu

  We propose a new mirror descent algorithm for the Plackett‚ÄìLuce model using a Hessian-based preconditioner, achieving improved regret bounds under the rank‚Äìdistributional equivalence framework.
